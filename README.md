This subgraph provide an standard erc-721 implementation, providing info about minting, transfer, bruning, approval. Additionally, this subgraph offers metadata about the evm actions such as Transaction and Block entities.

Also, this subgraph provides a lightweight approach to the Digital Media environment extending the standard erc-721 approach into a more board range without adding complexity.

This versi√≥n lacks of factory contract pattern support. Making it unable to track DigitalMedia as independent, pausable, single creator contracts but as an interface of an extended set of fungible and semi-fungible on top of a erc-721. By this reason, the pause, unpause, and singleCreator are not being indexed.

This subgraph index the contract "makers token v2" deployed on the following address:

	0x2a46f2ffd99e19a89476e2f62270e0a35bbf0756


## erc721Transaction

	Transfer(indexed address,indexed address,indexed uint256)

This interface provides useful information about basic Ercc-721 operations. 

Please see the TransactionMeta entity to get info about the chain's transactions

Relates to a "from" account, a "to" account, a block and a token. 

The transaction interface provides additional support trough the following entities:

	Mint, Burn, Transfer

```graphql
{
   Transactions
	   id
	   type
	   ...on Mint{
		   to {
			   address
		   }
	   }
	   ...on Burn{
		   form {
			   address
		   }
	   }
	   ...on Transfer{
		   from{
			   address
		   }
		   to{
			   address
		   }
	   }
   }
}
```
