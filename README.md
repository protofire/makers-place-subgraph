This subgraph provide an standard erc-721 implementation, providing info about minting, transfer, bruning, approval. Additionally, this subgraph offers metadata about the evm actions such as Transaction and Block entities.

Also, this subgraph provides a lightweight approach to the Digital Media environment extending the standard erc-721 approach into a more board range without adding complexity.

This versi√≥n lacks of factory contract pattern support. Making it unable to track DigitalMedia as independent, pausable, single creator contracts but as an interface of an extended set of fungible and semi-fungible on top of a erc-721. By this reason, the pause, unpause, and singleCreator are not being indexed.

This subgraph index the contract "makers token v2" deployed on the following address:

	0x2a46f2ffd99e19a89476e2f62270e0a35bbf0756

# Erc721 support

This section provides an overview of the standard erc721 support to makersplace.

## erc721Transactions

	Transfer(indexed address,indexed address,indexed uint256)

This interface provides useful information about basic Ercc-721 operations. 

Please see the TransactionMeta entity to get info about the chain's transactions

Relates to a "from" account, a "to" account, a block and a token. 

The transaction interface provides additional support trough the following entities:

	Mint, Burn, Transfer

```graphql
{
   TokenTransactions(first:20)
	   id
	   type
	   ...on Mint{
		   to {
			   address
		   }
	   }
	   ...on Burn{
		   form {
			   address
		   }
	   }
	   ...on Transfer{
		   from{
			   address
		   }
		   to{
			   address
		   }
	   }
   }
}
```


## OperatorOwner

	ApprovalForAll(indexed address,indexed address,bool)

In order to support "approval for all" Accounts are related as "many to many" using the OperatorOwner entity.

```graphql
# working with Transactions
{
	operatorOwners(first:20){
		approved
		owner{
			address
		}
		operator{
			address
		}
		transaction{
			hash
			block{
				number
			}
		}
	}
}

```

## Token

	Generated(indexed uint256,indexed address,string)

The Token entity provides an standard erc-721 token interface wich also holds the uri, an string representation of the nft's art.

```graphql
# working with Transactions
{
	tokens(first:20){
		approval{
			address
		}
	}
}
```
# Evm metadata

This sections offers a view into the support for evm block and transactions

## Block

This entity loaded/created on each handler, the propourse is to provide a minimum way to index and present data over time. 

```graphql
{
	blocks(first:20){
	timestamp
	number
	erc721TransactionsCount
	erc721Transactions(first:2){
		from{
			address
		}
		to{
			address
		}
	}
	}
}
```

## Transaction 

This entity is created paired w/ the blocks entity and is intended to provide a more detaileed entity for the time series indexation.

```graphql
{
	transactions(first:20){
		hash
		gasUsed
		block{
			timestamp
		}
	}
}
```

# Digital media

Here's where maker'splace core features are described.

As the dynamic data-template pattern wasn't used, this subgraph doesn't index follwing events:


	- Pause()
	- Unpause()
	- SingleCreatorChanged(indexed address,indexed address)
 
## DigitalMediaCollection

	- DigitalMediaCollectionCreateEvent(uint256,address,address,string)

The digital media collection provides an entity to store the collection and related digital media entities.


```graphql
{
	digitalMediaCollections(first:20){
		creator {
			address
		}
		digitalMediaAmount
		digitalMedia{
			storeContractAddress
		}
	}
}
```

## DigitalMedia

    - event: DigitalMediaCreateEvent(uint256,address,address,uint32,uint32,uint256,string)

This entity provides a way to store the first class citizen of this project, a non fungible token. The digital Media entity provides info about the art creation itself and relates to it's current owner, collection, and so on.


```graphql
{
	digitalMedias(first: 20){
		creator {
			address
		}
		collection {
			metadataPath
		}
		releases(first: 5) {
			tokenURI
		}
		metadataPath
		totalSupply
	}
}
```

## Digital Media Release

	- event: DigitalMediaReleaseCreateEvent(uint256,address,uint32,string,uint256)

This entitiy stores the semi fungible tokens related to the DigitalMedia entity.


```graphql
{
	digitalMediaReleases(first: 20){
		creator {
			address
		}
		digitalMedia {
			collection {
				metadataPath
			}
			metadataPath
		}
		printEdition
		tokenUri
	}
}
```
